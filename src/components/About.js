              The improvements in technology over the last short 15 years have
              been huge. We interact with technology on a daily basis and the
              tech industry now has one of the most significant impacts on the
              world. The industry is constantly changing and{" "}
              <mark className="highlight">
                I believe that change is good, and that learning should never
                stop.

              I love learning new things on a daily basis as a Developer and
              being at the forefront of this phenomenal industry. Over the last
              several years things have begun moving incredibly fast and web
              development is becoming even more important as Web Apps replace
              traditional software.

              I am obsessed with details (in a good way), clean beautiful UIs
              and easy-to-use functionality. Putting myself in the userâ€™s shoes
              during development, then fine-tuning the product with user
              feedback is something I will spend extra time on. I know that often,{" "}
